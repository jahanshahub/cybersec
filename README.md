# cybersec

My strengths involve adaptability and the ability to react to the given situation. I pride myself in knowing a breadth of tools that allow me to remain flexible and nimble when responding to issues or situations. I am able to take assessment of a situation with careful, calm and meticulous consideration and can then follow with a focused presentation of fact coupled with an objective plan of action that satisfies the organizations top priorities. 

My values are about security, integrity of data and of persons, and doing the right thing. Cybersecurity interests me as it is a crossroads of human experience and response coupled with data systems and technical structures that when used properly can be highly supportive to an organizations goals. Conversely, when not implemented or respected appropriately can become the swift downfall of any organization. 

Overall, my strengths bring a unique perspective from various industries without sacrificing operational expertise. I am seeking to provide value to organizations with a friendly attitude alongside a knowledgeable approach to any task at hand. My goal is to secure assets, data and future trajectories of the company for the success of all stakeholders - without sacrificing values or respect.
